This is a port of the Objective C code from Gustavo Ambrozio's How To Make a Catapult Shooting Game tutorial found here:
http://www.raywenderlich.com/4756/how-to-make-a-catapult-shooting-game-with-cocos2d-and-box2d-part-1

I tried to follow Gustavo's conventions to a certain degree, however I took a different path for naming instance member variables.

The code was tagged after each chapter was completed as follows:
